<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> What can you tell me about docker? Describe the various steps needed to get an app ran inside a docker container in your own words</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Docker is an open platform for app development, delivery, and running. Both the<br>application and the infrastructure may be controlled independently. It aids in deployment and<br>accessibility. It essentially automates software in lightweight containers. It includes all of the<br>requirements needed to launch a program.</div><div>Two Deployment action .yml files are created for<br>the two dynos: dev and prod. The .yml files code contains automated push<br>if the dev branch changes; similarly, we may add branches to automate pull<br>requests. The database URL, port, and working directory are also specified, followed by<br>action instructions. The docker container is built, pushed, and released to the Heroku<br>app using key secrets previously added to GitHub such as email, API key,<br>app name, and so on. Mention the docker build commands as well. The<br>python:3.10-slim image is used as the base image in the docker file. Set<br>environment variables like the port and transfer the local code to the container<br>image. On container startup, install the requirements file and execute the web service<br>with one worker process and eight threads. Increase the number of employees if<br>there are multiple CPU cores.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> What is Heroku? Why do you feel it was chosen for this class?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Heroku is a container-based cloud Platform as a Service that developers may use<br>to manage and scale modern applications. New apps/ dynos have been created that<br>work as building blocks, operated as virtual machines that can be powered up<br>or down based on modern applications. These dynos are application containers on a<br>fully managed runtime environment. It is a cloud platform as a service supporting<br>several programming languages. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in<br>development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but<br>now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It is chosen for<br>this class because it allows us to focus on the code instead of<br>infrastructure, it is comparatively easy to use, and it is readily and freely<br>available for students.</div><div><span style="background-color: rgb(32, 33, 36); color: rgb(189, 193, 198); font-family: Roboto,<br>arial, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div><br></div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 3: </em> What is flask? List a few things you learned about it</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>Flask is a web application framework that provides back-end components to aid in<br>the creation of applications. Built-in code packages automate operations, reducing the amount of<br>effort and coding necessary for application development. It is a micro web framework<br>written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not<br>require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation,<br>or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A few things<br>I learned about flask are,&nbsp;Flask is a web framework, and it's a Python<br>module that lets you develop web applications easily.&nbsp; It does have many cool<br>features like URL routing, and a template engine that we can easily use<br>in Heroku for application development.</div><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> What is the difference between a Dockerfile and a Github Action .yml file?</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <div>.yml file - The action.yml file is a metadata file that allows changes<br>in the branch to trigger multiple consequences. The.yml file contains all of the<br>instructions and details for the actions and associated triggers. It is a file<br>where we define our workflow, here we can give the things like branch<br>name, directory, etc, and, later we can use this file for building our<br>app.</div><div><br></div><div>Dockerfile - A Dockerfile is a text file that contains all of the<br>instructions that a user may use on the command line to build an<br>image. We can put the port number, requirements, etc in the Dockerfile. A<br>specific configuration file is used, with the docker image being python:3.10-slim. It aids<br>in the execution of our flask application.</div><br></td></tr>
